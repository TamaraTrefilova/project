        <p class="intro">Hi, my name is Tamara Trefilova. I am a hands-on Software Quality Assurance Test Engineer with a medical background.
          Initially I am from Russia. I was first introduced to programming when my friends asked me to help them to test their online graphics editor,
          so I become a part of a startup team. My first language was HTML.
          When I decided to learn a more complicated topic: object-oriented language Java, JavaScript.
          I took courses on Coursera.com, Edx.org.
          I always wanted to learn how to code in a more efficient way. It is why
          I decided to join the Epicodus full-time program. I want to improve my coding skills and try to switch from a quality assurance role to a developer. </p>
